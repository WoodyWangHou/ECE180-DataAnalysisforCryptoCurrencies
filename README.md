# ECE180-DataAnalysisforCryptoCurrencies
Team 7:
Course Project ECE180 - Data analysis for cryptocurrencies and understanding its pricing trends and risk.

# Proposal Team 7: 
## Analyzing Cryptocurrencies Pricing and Risk
#### What is the purpose of this project? 
Understand the factors that drive cryptocurrency prices and also understand why people are investing in this market. 
#### What problem are you trying to address with data? 
Understand if bitcoin is a bubble  and how people can benefit from investing in cryptocurrency.
#### Where are you getting the data (should be publicly available)? 
- Kaggle
- https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data
- https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory
- https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/ethereum-historical-data
- Kraken
- https://www.kraken.com/help/api
#### Why should anyone care?
- The stakeholders are the people that have invested in the markets, basically to address if investors should be concerned about their investments [i.e. if market is just a bubble].
- The people who are interested in investing cryptocurrency, revealing the risk that new investors need to consider.
#### What is your approach to using the data for to address the project's purpose?  
- Financial Ratio reference: https://coinmarketcap.com
- Analyzing the daily volume and price of the cryptocurrencies accross all of the markets and how much it compares to the rising popularity of this new form of investment in the general public.
- Analyzing the long-term price trending and important news on the specific breaking-point.
#### How do you know the data is relevant to your purpose? 
- The datasets that we will be using is the price at which the cryptocurrencies have been traded at. With these data sets we can analyze trading volume, the different markets, and how active [both socially and development] these projects are.
#### How are you going to extract and transform the data to get at the variables you want to address your question. 
- Extracting historical data from Kaggle, the data is already formatted by people contributing to the public datasets. 
- Will be using the raw data to generate financial ratios for analysis, 
#### What Python modules do you plan to use? 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- More to add on as we progress
#### Why did you choose them over others?
The other ones are too advanced for us lol
A draft graphic (can be hand-drawn for now)

Correlation of price trends and news categories; which type of news will affect the price points.
#### How will this work get done? 
- Use github to collaborate on code to analyze cryptocurrency data sets
- Github Repo: https://github.com/WoodyWangHou/ECE180-DataAnalysisforCryptoCurrencies.git
- Draw some nice figures
- Put together a small timeline including milestones (e.g., download data, make tables, format data, remove errors) for each of your project team members and indicate when each milestone will be reached and who is responsible for each milestone.
#### Timeline:
- download data [week 7]Jahya
- make tables[week 7]Jahya 
- format data [week 8] Bohan
- remove errors [week 8]Allan
- Extract features/ratios [week 9] Hou Wang
- isualize data [week 9]Allan
